## Overview
```
This repository contains 3 folders. 

R: 
contains the R scripts for replicating the simulation and real data results along with the figures in the manuscript.

Data: 
contains subset of two real data used in this study. Data1:  To download the full data please click on this link 

Man: 
contains the files and results from our analysis that will be taken in as input by few functions in the R filder for replicating the simulation and real data results along with the figures in the manuscript.

## Usage

```
BFDAM1: This is one of our proposed function which fits a Bayesian functional data analysis model by assuming the contiguous sequence of windows/regions are independent of each other while accounting for dependency of observations inside a particular window/region. 

BFDAM2: This is one of our proposed function which fits a Bayesian functional data analysis model by assuming the contiguous sequence of windows/regions are dependent of each other as well as accounting for dependency of observations inside a particular window/region.
